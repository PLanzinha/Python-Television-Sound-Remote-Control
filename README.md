The finality of this project is to allow the user to run the script with an IDE and be able to set the max volume the Television can achieve, it allows for any volume below that, but higher than the volume that was set it will revert to the set value, the script once run is always checking the sound level, having a timer so that it checks every 3 or so seconds, any user can set their own max sound level as well as the timer.
